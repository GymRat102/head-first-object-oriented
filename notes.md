### Simple implementation
- worked, but has a few problems
- Need to collect **_requirements_**
  - sometimes customer even don't know, need to ask question
  - show work progress
  - requirements also include **what might go wrong**
  - consideration includes...**people who use the system**
- use case
  - definition: the steps system make to make things happen
    - e.g. user lets dog go outside, do its business, and go back
    - key elements:
      - system
      - end users
      - interaction
      - specific goals
      - one or more scenarios
    - three parts:
      - clear value
      - Start and stop
      - external initiator
  - alternative path
    - extra steps to handle _what might go wrong_
- other points
  - **a use case** is **a particular goad**
  - use case is in everyday words, not code-level detains
  - use case help, but not directly tell you how to write code
  - requirement covers steps in use case
  - use case reveal incomplete and missing requirement
  - most user cases have different scenarios, sharing same user goal
- OO principles
  - encapsulate what varies (later chapter explained)
    - reduce duplicate code --> let door handle automatically closing itself, move out of devices(remote, recognizer) that controll the door
